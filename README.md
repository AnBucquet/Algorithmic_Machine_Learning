# Algorithmic_Machine_Learning

## Introduction 

This repository contains all the projects I did with **[jbdrvl](https://jbdrvl.github.io)** for the **[Algorithmic Machine Learning Course](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/AML-2018Spring)** (see **[course repository](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/Algorithmic-Machine-Learning))**  at **[Eurecom](http://www.eurecom.fr/en)**.

## Technical Aspect:

   We used the EURECOM cloud computing platform to work on our Notebooks. Our cluster is managed by Zoe, which is a container-based analytics-as-a-service system that Eurecom has built. Notebooks front-end run in a user-facing container, whereas Notebooks kernel run in clusters of containers. For this course, we focus on Apache Spark kernel. All of our Notebooks are configured to use Spark Python API.
