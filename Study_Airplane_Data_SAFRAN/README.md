# SAFRAN Notebook

This Notebook was done as part of a collaboration between our school and SAFRAN. They provided us with real aeronautical data so that we could study and then analyze it. 

The dataset they provided us with was the data from airplane flights, giving for a given flight the latitude, longitude, speed, ... for each second of the flight. 

The first part of the Notebook was designed for us to study and understand the dataset, and to try to find the best way to visualize it. 

The second part was dedicated to *data analysis*, and more specifically to try to predict some part of our dataset. To do so, we tried two different models: a simple polynomial model and ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average).
